## Topology 1

With sensory and afferent activities.

### Afferent and sensory activities (EES + 10% Afferent and sensory fibers spike)

![Sens](https://github.com/research-team/memristive-spinal-cord/blob/master/reflex_arc/neuron/second_layer/res/membS1_40hz_v3.png)

### EES 40Hz 100% inhibitory (100% Afferent and sensory fibers spike)

We can notice that Motoneuron doesn't respond to all EES stimulation. It happens because of afferent and sensory fibers activities. The frequency on sensory inputs is equal to 60 Hz. Because of this EES stimulus 2, 4, 6 occur during the refractory period.

#### Second layer potential

In this plot we also can see influence of sensory fibers activity on second layer.

### EES 40Hz 100% inhibitory (10% Afferent and sensory fibers spike)

Then we reduced the active afferent and sensory fibers to 10%. This led to decrease the effect of sensory fibers activity on second layer. But because of connection between Interneuronal pool and sensory fibers EES stimulus 4, 6 occur during the refractory period.

#### Second layer potential

There are 4 sublayers enough for delay.

### EES 40Hz 100% inhibitory (10% Afferent and sensory fibers spike) without IP-S1 connection

We get the necessary Motoneurons activity without connection between Interneuronal pool and sensory fibers.

### Only Afferent activity

### Without second layer (ESS, Afferents and Sensory fibers)

We can notice that delay during the 1-4 period without second layer.

## Сomparison with experimental data

In our model, response from second level comes earlier than in the experimental data.
