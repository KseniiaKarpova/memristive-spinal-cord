Model of the reflex arc

![Figure](memristive_reflex_arc.png)

Figure 1. 
Motoneuron "Moto", inhibitory interneuron "In", afferent fibers "Ia" and "II". 
Afferents "Ia" and "II" connect to two generators.
Afferent "Ia" excites glutamine motoneuron.
And afferent "II" excites glutamine interneuron,
that has inhibits GABA motoneuron.

Figure 2. 
Generator rate 40 Hz. 
Afferent fiber "II" excites interneuron "In" cause a spike.
That has trigger hyperpolarization of membrane potential of motoneuron.
Indicated in the graph "Moto".
Spike from afferent "Ia" at 20 ms excites motoneuron and triggers depolarization.
Then at 33 ms "In" inhibits "Moto" and cause hyperpolarization.
After 8 ms afferent "Ia" excites motoneuron triggers a spike.
Next spike from "In" triggers hyperpolarization of membrane potential.




Fiber "II" excites interneuron "In" and it inhibits motoneuron "Moto". 
Hyperpolarization arises.
In this time fiber "Ia" excites "Moto" and depolarization arises, but doesn't reach threshold.
At 33 ms "In" inhibits "Moto" and arises hyperpolarization.
After 10 ms impulse from "Ia" induce spike in "Moto".
Then fiber "Ia" once more excites "Moto" and again spike arises.
Next 20 ms spikes don't arise.
Only hyperpolarization, due to inhibition by "In".
At 80 ms spike arises due to impulse from "Ia".
Then "In" inhibits "Moto" and arises hyperpolarization.
After 1 ms "Ia" excites "Moto" and impulse arises, but doesn't reach threshold.
Time of simulation finished.

Figure 3. 
Generator rate 300 Hz.
Fiber "II" excites interneuron "In" and it inhibits motoneuron "Moto". 
Hyperpolarization arises.
In this time fiber "Ia" excites "Moto".
Impulse arises, but doesn't reach threshold.
Next impulse from "Ia" induce spike in "Moto".
Then fiber "Ia" once more excites "Moto".
Impulse arises and again doesn't reach threshold.
But with the following excitation from "Ia", spike arises.
Next 40 ms in "Moto" spikes don't arise.
Only impulses, which does't reach threshold, because of inhibition by "In".
At 90 ms in "Moto" spike arises due to impulse from "Ia".
Time of simulation finished.
