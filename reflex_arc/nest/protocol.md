## Protocol

Protocol for simulation of the reflex arc with one neuron per group

![Figure](result.png)  

The diagram shows four neurons: "in", "moto", "ia" and "ii'. 
Neurons "ia" and "ii" connect with two generators, which rate of 300 Hz. Neuron "ii" excites glutamine interneuron "in", which inhibits GABA motoneuron "moto". And neuron "ia" excites glutamine motoneuron "moto".
