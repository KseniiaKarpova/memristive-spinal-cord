Model of the reflex arc

![Figure](memristive_reflex_arc.png)

Figure 1. 
Motoneuron "Moto", inhibitory interneuron "In", afferent fibers "Ia" and "II". 
Afferents "Ia" and "II" connect to two generators.
Afferent "Ia" excites glutamine motoneuron.
And afferent "II" excites glutamine interneuron,
that has inhibits GABA motoneuron.

Figure 2. 
Generator rate 40 Hz. 
Afferent fiber "II" excites interneuron "In" cause a spike.
That has trigger hyperpolarization of membrane potential of motoneuron.
Indicated in the graph "Moto".
Spike from afferent "Ia" at 20 ms excites motoneuron and causes depolarization,
 which doesn't reach the threshold and fades.
Then at 33 ms interneuron inhibits "Moto" and triggers hyperpolarization.
After this afferent "Ia" excites motoneuron cause a spike.
Next spike from "In" triggers hyperpolarization of membrane potential.
And at 80 ms exciting from "Ia" causes a spike in motoneuron.
Then inhibition by interneuron triggers hyperpolarization.
Spike from afferent "Ia" in 92 ms excites motoneuron and causes depolarization.
Time of simulation finished.
