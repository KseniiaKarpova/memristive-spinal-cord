### About
Model of ES (Electric stimulation) of spinal cord. It should enhance walking cycle with correct parameters.

#### Some biology intro
Muscle is innervated by motoneurons (efferents), sensory neurons (afferents). They can be classified.

**Motoneurons**
- Alpha motoneurons. Innervate muscles. Convey signals to contraction/stretch.
- Gamma motoneurons. Innervate muscle spindles. Convey signals to contraction/stretch.

**Sensory neurons**
- Group 1.
  - Group 1a. Innervates muscle spindles. Conveys input about contraction/stretch. Fast. It excites its agonist, inhibits antagonist.
  - Group 1b. Innervates junction between muscle and its tendon. Not presented on images. Conveys input about its own contraction/stretch. It inhibits its agonist.
- Group 2. Innervates muscle spindles. Conveys input about contraction/stretch. Slow. It excites its agonist, inhibits antagonist. When a muscle is relaxed, all of its afferents are zero. Lets contract the muscle. Information about its contraction/stretch is conveyed with 0.2s delay here comparing to Group 1a.
